### Environment Setup

1. At the root of the project, duplicate the example file to create your local `.env` file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.exemple .env
   ```

## Docker

A development `Dockerfile` runs the API with hot-reload (via [air](https://github.com/air-verse/air)),
meant to be plugged as-is into the project's docker-compose.

Build the image:

```sh
make docker-build
```

Run it locally with hot-reload (mounts the source code and exposes the app on the host port set by
`PORT` in `.env`, `8092` by default):

```sh
make docker-dev
```

Then check it with `curl http://127.0.0.1:8092/agent`. Editing any `.go` file rebuilds and restarts
the server automatically inside the container. The container itself always listens on `0.0.0.0:8080`
(overridden from `.env`'s `HTTP_ADDR` by the `docker-dev` target); only the host-side port, read from
`PORT` in `.env`, changes.
